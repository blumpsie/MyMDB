Marlon Brando portrays Don Vito Corleone, composed of characteristics 
of many gangsters. The Vito Corleone character is based largely on 
those of Frank Costello and Carlo Gambino. Like Costello, Vito has 
a raspy voice, has politicians and judges on his payroll, discourages 
others getting into the narcotics business, and has many gambling 
interests. Like Gambino, Vito is very cunning.
