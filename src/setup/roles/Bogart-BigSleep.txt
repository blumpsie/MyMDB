Philip Marlowe is a hard-drinking, tough-talking private detective created by 
Raymond Chandler. He is the protagonist in a series of eight novels, the first 
being "The Big Sleep", published in 1939.

Phillip Marlowe is the kind of guy we all needed at the birth cry of the 
20th century. Hell, every era needs a man like this. Not just an ace detective, 
but a true white knight and a nobleman. His first cut his teeth as an 
investigator in college for an insurance company.
